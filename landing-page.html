    <p>Spiral puts the power of time managment in your corner with a simple methodology - estimate how a long a task will take with the provided values, start the clock, mindfully take a break, repeat.
    </p>

    <p>Great for students, freelancers, remote workers... </p>

    <p>Why do traditional time managment tools fail?</p>

    <p>Uninteresting, they provide no invovlment or time awarness</p>



    <p>Unbounded, they provide no principal for how long to take on a task, or when to take a break, other than frustration, fatige, or burn out.</p>

    <p>Spiral is a mindfulness app, but with all the benefits of a workplace productivty tool - and more!</p>

    <p>Track your time, improve your time estimation skills, assess your productivity, and improve the cognitive link between time and task completion.</p>
