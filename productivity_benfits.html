    Improves meta-cognition (thinking about the task you want to accomplish before doing it).
    <br> <br> Charts your time spent in focus, vs break.
    <br> <br> Adds a time factor that encourages you to move through tasks more quickly, but without imposing ridged timeframes (that can cause stress).
    <br> <br> Helps you become more efficient at knowing how long tasks will take.
    <br> <br> Easy to operate - keep it open in a browser window while studying or doing computer work and it takes one click to begin a cycle.
