            <h2>Weber’s Law</h2>
            <br> Imagine someone hands you two rocks. One weighs 1 pound, and the other weighs 2 pounds. With one in each hand, it isn’t too difficult to tell which one is which. The 2 pound rock is twice as heavy as the 1 pound rock, with an overall
            weight increase of 100%.
            <br> But imagine being handed a 20 pound rock and a 21 pound rock. They are still only one pound different, but it is much harder to tell them apart. That’s because in this case the second rock is only 5% heavier. This is an example of Weber’s
            Law, which states that the difference we can identify between objects is given by percentage. <br>
            <br>
            <h2>The Fibonacci Series and Time Estimating</h2>
            <br> The values in the Fibonacci series work well for time estimating because they roughly correspond to Weber’s law. In the Fibonacci series, each new number is the sum of the two previous numbers, which creates about a 60% increase at each
            new interval (excluding 1 + 1 = 2 which is obviously 100%). That means that the Fibonacci series gives a consistent and meaningful progression of intervals that can be used to quickly choose a ballpark estimate.
