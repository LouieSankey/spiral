    <h2 class="underline">Why Spiral? </h2>
    <br> Imaging holding two rocks, one weighs one pound and the other weighs two pounds. It isn’t too hard to tell which of these two rocks is heavier.
    <br> <br> But imagine holding a twenty pound rock and a twenty one pound rock. The task of discerning the difference becomes much harder.
    <br> <br> And the same applies to the time it takes to complete a task.
    <br> <br> For a small task, it’s easy to tell whether it’s more likely to take five minutes or ten minutes.
    <br> <br> But with a larger task, the same five minute difference becomes less consequential and harder to account for. (Think forty-five minutes vs fifty minutes, for example.)
    <br> <br> Spiral solves this by providing a proportional framework where smaller estimates are closer together and larger estimates are spaced farther apart.
    <br> <br> This makes it ideally suited for quickly sizing up a task before beginning, or deciding how to break a large task down into subtasks.
    <br> <br> Simply estimate a timeframe for any task, and with one click Spiral helps you stay on track, and challenges you to move through it quickly and without distraction.
